To make a commit that looks like it was done in the past you have to set both GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE:

GIT_AUTHOR_DATE=$(date -d'...') GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="$GIT_AUTHOR_DATE" git commit -m '...'
where date -d'...' can be exact date like 2019-01-01 12:00:00 or relative like 5 months ago 24 days ago.

To see both dates in git log use:

git log --pretty=fuller
