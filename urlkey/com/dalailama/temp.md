# The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama

The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL), known in Tibetan as *Kuger Yigtsang*, is the personal office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. It provides secretarial assistance to His Holiness and broadly speaking, is responsible for all matters related to His Holiness and acts on his behalf.

Among OHHDL's main responsibilities are:

1. Organization of His Holiness the Dalai Lama's schedule, including appointments and his travels within India and to different parts of the world;
1. Handling all diplomatic, governmental and personal correspondence, on behalf of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
1. Acting as the liaison between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and officials of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.

When His Holiness is in Dharamsala, his schedule usually includes his daily religious practice and studies taking up the mornings. In the afternoons, His Holiness holds audiences with people, both Tibetans and non-Tibetans. His Holiness also has some administrative duties such as meeting with the Tibetan Kashag (Cabinet) as well as senior Tibetan governmental officials.

Although in the initial years His Holiness had a flexible and relaxed schedule, engagements, especially travels and teachings throughout the world, have increased tremendously the workload at OHHDL.

Opportunities to meet with His Holiness in Dharamsala are generally divided into three categories: a) public audiences; b) private audiences; and c) media interviews. However, on the advice of His Holiness’ doctors and other concerned people, the number of His Holiness’ audiences and interviews are being reduced.
