<h2>Status of This Document</h2>

<p>This draft specification is a work in progress representing the current
consensus of the W3C RDF Model and Syntax Working Group.  This is
a W3C Working Draft for review by W3C members and other interested
parties.  Publication as a working draft does not imply endorsement
by the W3C membership.  While the design has stabilized quite a bit
since the previous version and we do not anticipate substantial
changes, we still caution that further changes are possible and
therefore we recommend that only experimental software or software
that can be easily field-upgraded be implemented to this specification
at this time.  The RDF Model and Syntax Working Group will not allow
early implementation to constrain their ability to make changes to
this specification prior to final release.  This is a draft document
and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to cite W3C Working Drafts as other than
"work in progress".</p>

<P><B>Note:</B> As working drafts are subject to frequent change, you are
advised to reference the above URL for &quot;Latest version&quot; rather

<H2><A NAME="intro"></A>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>RDF – the Resource Description Framework – is a foundation for processing
metadata; it provides interoperability between applications that exchange
machine-understandable information on the Web. RDF emphasizes facilities
to enable automated processing of Web resources. RDF metadata can be used
in a variety of application areas; for example: in <I>resource discovery</I>
to provide better search engine capabilities; in <I>cataloging</I> for
describing the content and content relationships available at a particular
Web site, page, or digital library; by <I>intelligent software agents</I>
to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange; in <I>content rating</I>;
in describing <I>collections</I> of pages that represent a single logical
&quot;document&quot;; for describing <I>intellectual property rights</I>
of Web pages, and in many others. RDF with <I>digital signatures</I> will
be key to building the &quot;Web of Trust&quot; for electronic commerce,
collaboration, and other applications.</P>

<P>Metadata is &quot;data about data&quot; or specifically in the context
of RDF &quot;data describing web resources&quot;. The distinction between
&quot;data&quot; and &quot;metadata&quot; is not an absolute one; it is
a distinction created primarily by a particular application. Many times
the same resource will be interpreted in both ways simultaneously. RDF
encourages this view by using XML as the encoding syntax for the metadata.
The resources being described by RDF are, in general, anything that can
be named via a URI. The broad goal of RDF is to define a mechanism for
describing resources that makes no assumptions about a particular application
domain, nor defines the semantics of any application domain. The definition
of the mechanism should be domain neutral, yet the mechanism should be
suitable for describing information about any domain.</P>

<P>This document introduces a model for representing RDF&nbsp;metadata
and one syntax for expressing and transporting this metadata in a manner
that maximizes the interoperability of independently developed web servers
and clients. The syntax described in this document is best considered as
a &quot;serialization syntax&quot; for the underlying RDF&nbsp;representation
model. The serialization syntax uses the eXtensible Markup Language
[<A HREF="/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>].
RDF and XML are complementary; there will be alternate ways to represent
the same RDF data model, some more suitable for direct human authoring.
Future work may lead to including such alternatives in this document.</P>

<H2><A NAME="model"></A>2. RDF Data Model</H2>

<P>At the core of RDF is a model for representing named properties and
their values. These properties serve both to represent attributes of resources
(and in this sense correspond to usual attribute-value pairs) and to represent
relationships between resources. The RDF&nbsp;data model is a syntax-independent
way of representing RDF expressions. This specification shows three representations
of the data model; as 3-tuples, as a graph, and in XML. These representations
have equivalent meaning. The mapping between the representations used in
this specification is not intended to constrain in any way the internal
representation used by implementations.</P>

<P>RDF expressions that are syntactically very different could mean
the same thing. This concept of equivalence in meaning is very important
when performing queries, aggregation and a number of other tasks at which
RDF is aimed. The equivalence is defined in a clean machine understandable
way. Two RDF expressions are equivalent if and only if their corresponding
data model representations are the same.
Two RDF string values (defined below) are deemed to be the same if their
ISO/IEC 10646 representations match.</p>

<H3>2.1. RDF&nbsp;Core; &quot;Layer 0&quot;</H3>

<P>The core data model is precisely defined as:</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL>
<LI>There is a set called <i>Nodes</i>.</LI>

<LI>There is a subset of <i>Nodes</i> called <i>PropertyTypes</i>.</LI>

<LI>There is a set of 3-tuples called <i>Triples</i>, whose elements are called
<i>properties</i>. The first item of each 3-tuple (triple) is an element of <i>PropertyTypes</i>,
the second item is an element of <i>Nodes</i> and the third item is either an
element of <i>Nodes</i> or an atomic value (an RDF string). </LI>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>In this&nbsp;data model both the resources being described and the values
describing them are represented as nodes in a directed labeled graph.
The arcs connecting pairs of nodes correspond
to the names of the property types. Each arc is said to be <I>labeled</I>
by the corresponding property type.</p>

<P>As RDF serialization is written in XML, the character repertoire of an RDF string is
ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO10646]. An actual RDF string, whether in an XML document
or in some other representation of the RDF data model, may be stored using
a direct encoding of ISO/IEC 10646 or an encoding which can be mapped to
ISO/IEC 10646. Language tagging is part of the string value; it is applied
to sequences of characters within an RDF&nbsp;string and does not have
an explicit manifestation in the data model.</P>

<P>Two RDF strings are deemed to be the same if their ISO/IEC 10646 representations
match. Each RDF application must specify which one of the following definitions
of 'match' it uses:</P>

<OL type=a>
<LI>the two representations are identical, or </LI>

<LI>the two representations are canonically equivalent as defined by The
Unicode Standard [Unicode].</LI>
</OL>

<P>The application may ignore language tagging within a string; all RDF
applications must specify whether or not language tagging in string values
is significant; that is, whether or not language is considered when performing
string matching or other processing.</P>

<p>An RDF expression is represented pictorially in text with nodes
in '[...]' and arcs in '--...--&gt;' as follows:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[resource R] ---PropertyType P--&gt; [value V]</PRE>
</UL>

<P>This is read &quot;V is the value of the property type P for resource
R&quot;, or left-to-right; &quot;R has property type P with value V&quot;.</P>

<P>Consider as a simple example the statement:</P>

<UL>
<P><I>Ora Lassila is the author of the resource http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila</I></P>
</UL>

<P>This statement can be represented as follows:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila] ---Author--&gt; &quot;Ora Lassila&quot;</PRE>
</UL>

<P>where the notation '[URI]' denotes the node representing the resource identified
by URI and quotation marks (&quot;) denote an atomic value.</P>

<P>According to the formal definition, this property, i.e. the arc labeled
&quot;Author&quot; plus its source and target nodes, is the triple:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>{Author, [http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila], &quot;Ora Lassila&quot;}</PRE>
</UL>

<P>where &quot;Author&quot; denotes a node in <i>PropertyTypes</i> that
corresponds to this arc label.
</P>

<P>A set of triples that all refer to the same node (the second
item in the triple) can be grouped as a unit called a <I>Description</I>.
Descriptions are particularly
useful when specifying a number of properties of the same resource.
A Description (here containing two properties) is diagrammed as follows:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[resource R] ---PropertyType P1--&gt; [value Vp1]
            |
             ---PropertyType P2--&gt; [value Vp2]

[Bag B] --------RDF:1------------&gt; [Property P1Vp1]
       |
        --------RDF:2------------&gt; [Property P2Vp2]</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Each RDF Description has its own node (the node identified as "Bag B"
in the diagram) identifying the collection
of triples, as described below. The Description can therefore be described
by properties; that is, a Description can itself be used as the source
node of other arcs describing properties of the Description.</P>

<P>The property types in a given Description, as well as any characteristics
or restrictions of the property values themselves, are defined by one or
more <I>schemas.</I> Each property type used in a Description is declared to
be from exactly one schema.
A schema is identified by a URI. The schema URI&nbsp;may
be treated merely as an identifier or it may refer to a machine-understandable
description of the schema. By definition, to <I>understand</I> a particular
schema used by a Description means to understand the semantics of each
of the properties in that Description that are declared to be associated
with the schema. An application that has no knowledge of the particular
schema will still be able to parse the Description into the property type
and property value components and will be able to transport the Description
intact (e.g. to a cache or to another application).</P>

<H3>2.2. Utility Relations; &quot;Layer 1&quot;</H3>

<P>The utility relations exist to permit Descriptions about Descriptions
and to provide definitions for collections of nodes.</P>

<P>The triple composed of a property type, a resource, and a value is an
RDF <I>property</I>. Such a property can
itself be the target node of an arc (i.e. the value of some other property)
or the source node of an arc (i.e. it can have properties). In these cases,
the original property must be <I>reified</I>; that
is, converted into additional nodes and arcs. The term <I>reification</I>
means to convert the relation expressed by the arc into a concrete node
to which we can refer. Reification allows us to express modalities (e.g.
beliefs about properties) or simply attach any properties to other properties.</P>

<P>For example, the reification of the expression</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila] ---Author--&gt; &quot;Ora Lassila&quot;</PRE>
</UL>

<P>is the four properties</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[X] ---InstanceOf--&gt; [RDF:Property]
[X] ---PropName----&gt; [Author]
[X] ---PropObj-----&gt; [http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila]
[X] ---Value-------&gt; &quot;Ora Lassila&quot;</PRE>
</UL>

<P>That is, a node X and four new triples are added:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>{InstanceOf, [X], [RDF:Property]}
{PropName,   [X], [Author]}
{PropObj,    [X], [http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila]}
{Value,      [X], &quot;Ora Lassila&quot;}</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Reified properties are drawn as a single node with several arcs emanating
from it representing the resource, property name, and value:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[property P1] ----InstanceOf-&gt; [RDF:Property]
             |
              ----PropName---&gt; [PropertyType P]
             |
              ----PropObj----&gt; [resource R]
             |
              ----Value------&gt; [value Vp1]</PRE>
</UL>

<P>This allows RDF&nbsp;to be used to make statements about other statements;
for example, the statement &quot;Ralph believes that the document 'The
Origin of Species' was authored by Charles Darwin&quot; is represented as:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>[Ralph] --Believes--&gt; [statement1] --InstanceOf-&gt; [RDF:Property]
                                  |
                                   --PropName---&gt; [Author]
                                  |
                                   --PropObj----&gt; [http://loc.gov/Books/Species]
                                  |
                                   --Value------&gt; &quot;Charles Darwin&quot;</PRE>
</UL>

<P>To help in reifying properties, RDF defines the <I>InstanceOf</I> relation
(property type) to provide primitive typing, as shown in the previous example.</P>

<P>The formal definition of <I>InstanceOf</I> is:</P>

<a name="InstanceOf"></a>
<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL start=4>
<LI>There is an element of <i>PropertyTypes</i> known as RDF:InstanceOf.</LI>

<LI>Elements of <i>Triples</i> that have RDF:InstanceOf as the first item in the
triple must have elements of <i>Nodes</i> as their second item and third item.
</LI>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The formal definition of reification is:</P>

<a name="Property"></a>
<a name="PropName"></a>
<a name="PropObj"></a>
<a name="Value"></a>
<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL start=6>
<LI>There is an element of <i>Nodes</i>, not contained in <i>PropertyTypes</i>, known
as RDF:Property.</LI>

<LI>There are three elements in <i>PropertyTypes</i> known as RDF:PropName, RDF:PropObj,
and RDF:Value.</LI>

<LI>The reification of an element <i>t</i> of <i>Triples</i> is an element <i>n</i>
of <i>Nodes</i> representing the reified <i>t</i> and the elements <i>t<SUB>1</SUB></i>, <i>t<SUB>2</SUB></i>,
<i>t<SUB>3</SUB></i>, and <i>t<SUB>4</SUB></i> of <i>Triples</i> where:</LI>

<OL type=a>
<LI>the first item of <i>t<SUB>1</SUB></i> is RDF:PropName, the second item is
<i>n</i>, and the third item is the first item of <i>t</i>,</LI>

<LI>the first item of <i>t<SUB>2</SUB></i> is RDF:PropObj, the second item is
<i>n</i>, and the third item is the second item of <i>t</i>,</LI>

<LI>the first item of <i>t<SUB>3</SUB></i> is RDF:Value, the second item is <i>n</i>,
and the third item is the third item of <i>t</i>,</LI>

<LI>the first item of <i>t<SUB>4</SUB></i> is RDF:InstanceOf, the second item
is <i>n</i>, and the third item is RDF:Property.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>To reify a property, all that is done is to add to the data model an
additional node and the four triples with first items (labeled arcs) of
RDF:PropName, RDF:PropObj, RDF:Value, and RDF:InstanceOf respectively,
second item the additional node, and third item the corresponding property
type, resource node, value node, and the RDF:Property node respectively.
Note the difference between the node RDF:Property and <i>properties</i>.
RDF:Property is the node defining a particular class of objects.  The
instances of that class are the properties; i.e. triples.</P>

<P>Frequently it is necessary to create a collection of nodes; for example to
state that a property has an ordered sequence of values. RDF&nbsp;defines three kinds
of collections: ordered lists of nodes, called <I>Sequences</I>, unordered
lists of nodes, called <I>Bags</I>, and lists that represent alternatives
for the (single) value of a property, called <I>Alternatives</I>.</P>

<P>Formally, these three collection types are defined by:</P>

<a name="Seq"></a>
<a name="Bag"></a>
<a name="Alt"></a>
<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL start=9>
<LI>There are three elements of <i>Nodes</i>, not contained in <i>PropertyTypes</i>,
known as RDF:Seq, RDF:Bag, and RDF:Alt.</LI>

<LI>There is a subset of <i>PropertyTypes</i> corresponding to the ordinals (1,
2, 3, ...) called Ord. We refer to elements of Ord as RDF:1, RDF:2, RDF:3,
... </LI>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>To create a collection of nodes, create a new node with an RDF:InstanceOf
arc pointing to one of the three node types RDF:Seq, RDF:Bag, or RDF:Alt.
The remaining arcs from that new node point to each of the members of the
collection and are labeled using the elements from Ord. There may be at
most one arc from a single collection node labeled with each element of
Ord and the elements of Ord must be used in sequence starting with RDF:1.
For nodes that are instances of the RDF:Alt collection type, there must
be exactly one member whose arc label is RDF:1 and that is the default
value for the Alternatives node. </P>

<h2><a name="transporting"></a>3. Transporting RDF</h2>

<P>Descriptions may be associated with the resource they describe in one
of four ways:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The Description may be contained within the resource (&quot;embedded&quot;;
e.g. <A HREF="#embedHTML">in HTML</A>).</LI>

<LI>The Description may be external to the resource but supplied by the
transfer mechanism in the same retrieval transaction as that which returns
the resource (&quot;along-with&quot;; e.g. <A HREF="#viaHTTP">via HTTP</A>).</LI>

<LI>The Description may be retrieved independently from the resource, including
from a different source (&quot;service bureau&quot;; e.g. <A HREF="#serviceBureau">using
HTTP</A>).</LI>

<LI>The Description may contain the resource (&quot;wrapped&quot;; e.g.
RDF itself).</LI>
</OL>

<P>All resources will not support all association methods; in particular,
many kinds of resources will not support embedding and only certain kinds
of resources may be wrapped.</P>


<P>A human- or machine-understandable description of an RDF schema may
be accessed through content negotiation by dereferencing the schema URI.
If the schema is machine-understandable it may be possible for an application
to learn some of the semantics of the property types named in the schema
on demand. The logic and syntax of RDF schemas are described in a separate
document; &quot;RDF Machine Understandable Schemas&quot; (in progress).</p>

<P>This specification does not define any schemas; all references in this
document to specific schema URIs and associated property types are intended
as illustration only.</P>

<H2><A NAME="grammar"></A>4. RDF&nbsp;Grammar</H2>

<P>The RDF data model provides an abstract, conceptual framework for defining
and using metadata. A concrete syntax is also needed for the purposes of
authoring and exchanging this metadata. The syntax does not add to the
model; APIs may be provided to manipulate RDF without reference to a concrete
syntax. RDF&nbsp;uses the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">Extensible
Markup Language</A> [XML] encoding as its syntax. However, RDF will not
require (and conforming implementations must not require) an XML Document
Type Declaration for the contents of Descriptions. In this respect RDF
requires at most the XML <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-well-formed">well-formedness</A>
constraints. Schemas used by RDF Descriptions can be XML DTDs however other
schema languages are expected to be more common for use with RDF.

<P>The syntax descriptions below use the Extended Backus-Naur Form notation
as defined in <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-notation">section 6, Notation</a>, of [<A HREF="/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>]
to describe the essential RDF syntax elements. The EBNF here
is condensed for human readability; in particular, the italicized
&quot;<I><tt>rdf</tt></I>&quot;
is used to represent a variable namespace name rather than the more precise
BNF notation &quot;<TT>'&lt;' NSname ':...'</TT>&quot; and the requirement
that the property and type names in end-tags exactly match the names in
the corresponding start-tags is implied by the XML&nbsp;rules. As RDF&nbsp;is
written using XML, all syntactic flexibilities of XML are also implicitly included; e.g.
whitespace rules, quoting using either single quote (') or double quote
(&quot;), <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-chardata">character escaping</A>,
case sensitivity, language tagging, etc. RDF&nbsp;requires the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119">XML
namespace facility</A>, currently under review by the XML Working Group,
to associate the schema, by way of its URI, with the properties in the
Description.</P>

<P>This specification defines two syntaxes for encoding an RDF&nbsp;data
model instance. The <I>serialization syntax</I> expresses the full capabilities
of the data model in a very regular fashion. The <I>abbreviated syntax</I>
includes additional constructs that provide a more compact form to represent
a subset of the data model. Conformant RDF interpreters are expected to
implement both the full serialization syntax and the abbreviated syntax.</P>

<H3>4.1 Serialization Syntax</H3>

<P>RDF&nbsp;serialization syntax takes the form:</P>

<PRE>  [1] RDF            ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:RDF&gt;' expression* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:RDF&gt;'
  [2] expression     ::= description | collection<a name="Description"></a>
  [3] description    ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Description' idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? '&gt;'
                              property* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Description&gt;'
  [4] collection     ::= sequence | bag | alternatives
  [5] sequence       ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Seq' idAttr? '&gt;' collMember* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Seq&gt;'
  [6] bag            ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Bag' idAttr? '&gt;' collMember* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Bag&gt;
  [7] alternatives   ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Alt' idAttr? '&gt;' collMember+ '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Alt&gt;'
  [8] collMember     ::= hrefItem | valueItem
  [9] hrefItem       ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:LI' hrefAttr '/&gt;'
 [10] valueItem      ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:LI&gt;' value '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:LI&gt;'
 [11] idRefAttr      ::= idAttr |&nbsp;hrefAttr
 [12] hrefAttr       ::= '<I>rdf</I>:HREF=&quot;' resourceURI '&quot;'
 [13] idAttr         ::= 'ID=&quot;' IDsymbol '&quot;'
 [14] bagIdAttr      ::= '<I>rdf</I>:BAGID=&quot;' IDsymbol '&quot;'
 [15] resourceURI    ::= (see RFC1738)
 [16] IDsymbol       ::= (any legal <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-Nmtoken">XML name symbol</A>)</PRE>

<P>The RDF element is a simple wrapper that marks the boundaries in an
XML document where the content is explicitly intended to be mappable into
an RDF data model instance.</p>

<p>Description contains the remaining elements
that cause the creation of properties in the model instance. Each XML element
<I>E</I> contained by a Description results in the creation of a property
(a triple that is an element of the formal set <i>Triples</i>), where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The first item (PropName) is the node that represents the resource whose URI is
the expansion of the namespace-qualified Generic Identifier (tag name)
of <I>E</I>.</LI>

<LI>The second item (PropObj) is</LI>

resource has no identification.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>If <I>E</I> is an empty element (no content), the third item (Value) is the node
that represents the resource whose URI is given by the HREF attribute of
<I>E</I>. If the content of <I>E</I> contains no XML markup, the Value
is the content of <I>E</I> (a string). Otherwise, the content of <i>E</i>
must be another Description or collection and the Value is the node
named by the (possibly implicit) ID or HREF of that Description or collection.</li>
</OL>

<P>The Description element itself creates an instance of a Bag node. The
members of this Bag are the nodes corresponding to the reification of each
of the properties in the Description. If the BAGID attribute is specified
its value is the identifier of this Bag, else the Bag is anonymous.</P>

<P>When HREF is specified with Description, the properties in the Description
refer to the resource named in the HREF.
A Description element without an HREF attribute creates an in-line resource.
Typically such a resource will be a surrogate, or proxy, for some other
real resource that does not have a recognizable URI. This in-line resource
has a URI formed using the value of the ID attribute of the Description
element, if present.
When another Description or
property value refers to the in-line resource it will use the value of
the ID in an HREF attribute.  When the other Description refers to the
bag of nodes corresponding to the reified properties it will use the
value of BAGID in an HREF attribute.
Either ID or HREF may be specified on Description
but not both together in the same element.
The values for each ID and BAGID attribute must not appear more than once
within a document nor may the same value be used in an ID and a BAGID; that
is, these two attributes have
<A HREF="/TR/REC-xml#NT-TokenizedType">XML&nbsp;AttType ID</A>.</P>

<P>Seq, Bag, and Alt create an instance of a sequence, bag, or alternatives
collection node type respectively. This node is the PropObj of an InstanceOf
property pointing to the corresponding collection node type. The members
of the collection are denoted by LI. Each XML element <I>E</I> contained
by an LI corresponds to one member of the collection and results in the
creation of a tuple where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The first item (PropName) is assigned consecutively according to the (XML) order
of lexical appearance of each member starting with &quot;RDF:1&quot; for
each collection.</LI>

<LI>The second item (PropObj) is a node <I>C</I> that represents the collection created
by the Seq, Bag, or Alt. The ID attribute, if specified, provides the URI
fragment identifier for <I>C</I>.</LI>

<LI>(same as rule 3 above) If <I>E</I> is an empty element (no content),
the third item (Value) is the node that represents the resource whose URI is given by
the HREF attribute of <I>E</I>. If the content of <I>E</I> contains no
XML markup, the Value is content of <I>E</I> (a string). Otherwise, the
content of <i>E</i>
must be another Description or collection and the Value is the node
named by the(possibly implicit) ID or HREF of that Description or collection.</li>
</OL>

<P>The resourceURI identifies the target resource; i.e. the resource to
which the Description applies or the resource that is included in the collection.
The BAGID attribute on a Description element and the ID attribute on a
collection element permit that Description or collection to be referred
to by other Descriptions. The ID on a collection element also provides
the name that is used in an HREF attribute on a property element to make
the collection the value of that property.</P>

<P>An RDF property takes the form:</P>

<PRE> [17] property       ::= '&lt;' propName idAttr? '&gt;' value '&lt;/' propName '&gt;'
                       | '&lt;' propName idRefAttr '/&gt;'
 [18] propName       ::= '<I>rdf</I>:Value' | '<I>rdf</I>:InstanceOf' | name
                       | NSname ':' name
 [19] value          ::= expression |&nbsp;string
 [20] name           ::= (any legal XML name symbol)
 [21] NSname         ::= (any legal XML namespace prefix)
 [22] string         ::= (any XML text, with &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;&amp;&quot; escaped)</PRE>

<P>Within <I>property</I>, the resourceURI used in an HREF attribute identifies
the resource that is the value of this property. The value of the ID attribute,
if specified, is the identifier for the node that represents the reification
of the property.  If an expression is specified as a property value the value
is the node given by the HREF of the Description or the (possibly implied) ID
of the Description or collection.
The propName Value may be used for expressing non-binary relations;
see example 5.3. <I><TT>String</TT></I>s must be well-formed XML; the usual
XML&nbsp;content quoting and escaping mechanisms may be used if the string
contains character sequences (e.g. &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot;)
that violate the well-formedness rules or that otherwise might look like
markup. The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag">xml:lang</A>
attribute may be used as defined by [<A HREF="/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>] to associate a language with
the property value. When used, xml:lang adds no triples to the data model.</P>

<P>It is recommended that property names always be qualified with a namespace
prefix to unambiguously connect the property definition with the corresponding
RDF&nbsp;schema.</P>

<H3>4.2 Abbreviated Syntax</H3>

<P>The RDF abbreviated syntax can be employed for each property in a Description
where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The given property name appears at most once in the Description and</LI>

<LI>The property value is a string.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The abbreviated syntax can also be employed for each property where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The property value is a node and</LI>

<LI>The values in any properties specified for that value node are strings.</LI>
</OL>

<P>In addition, the abbreviated syntax provides a shorthand for specifying
a node with an InstanceOf property.</P>

<P>The abbreviated syntax replaces productions [3] and [17] of the grammar
for the serialization syntax in the following manner:</P>

<PRE>  [3a] description    ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Description' idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/&gt;'
                        | '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Description' idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '&gt;'
                              property* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Description&gt;'
                        | typedNode
 [17a] property       ::= '&lt;' propName idAttr? '&gt;' value '&lt;/' propName '&gt;'
                        | '&lt;' propName idRefAttr? bagIDAttr? propAttr* '/&gt;'
  [23] typedNode      ::= '&lt;' typeName idRefAttr? bagIDAttr? propAttr* '/&gt;'
                        | '&lt;' typeName idRefAttr? bagIDAttr? propAttr* '&gt;'
                              property* '&lt;/' typeName '&gt;'
  [24] typeName       ::= NSname ':' name
  [25] propAttr       ::= propName '=&quot;' string '&quot;'
                          (with embedded quotes escaped)</PRE>

<P>Each property type and value expressed in XML&nbsp;attribute form by
productions [3a] and [25] is equivalent to the same property type and value
expressed as XML&nbsp;content of the corresponding Description according
to production [17]. Specifically; each XML attribute <I>A</I> specified
with a Description start tag other than the attributes
ID, HREF, or BAGID results in the
creation of a property (a triple), where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The PropName (first item) is the node that represents the resource whose URI is
the expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute name of <I>A</I>.</LI>

<LI>The PropObj (second item) is the node that represents the resource whose URI is given
by the value of the HREF attribute or whose identifier is given by the
value of the ID attribute of the Description.</LI>

<LI>The Value (third item) is the attribute value of <I>A</I> (a string).</LI>
</OL>

<P>The typedNode form may be used to create or declare instances of nodes
of specific types and to further describe those nodes.
A Description expressed in typedNode form by production [23] is equivalent
to the same Description expressed by production [3a] with the
same ID, BAGID, and HREF attributes plus an additional InstanceOf property in
the Description where the value of the InstanceOf property is the fully
expanded URI corresponding to the typeName of the typedNode. Specifically,
when a typedNode is given, each XML attribute <I>A</I>
other than ID, HREF, or BAGID and each property <I>P</I> result in the
creation of a triple where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The first item (PropName) is the node that represents the resource whose URI is
the expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute name of <I>A</I> or
the property name of <I>P</I>.</LI>

<LI>The second item (PropObj) is the node <I>n</I> that represents the resource whose
URI is given by the value of the HREF attribute or whose identifier is
given by the value of the ID attribute of the typedNode element.</LI>

<LI>The third item (Value) is the attribute value of <I>A</I> (a string) or the value
of <I>P</I>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>plus an additional triple where the PropObj is the same node <I>n</I>,
the PropName is RDF:InstanceOf, and the Value is the node represented by
the typeName in the typedNode. If the typedNode is given as the value of
a property, the node <I>n</I> is the Value of that property
in which the typedNode was specified.</P>

<P>Property types and values expressed in XML attribute form by productions
[17a] and [25] are equivalent to the same property types and values expressed
as XML content of a single Description element <I>D</I> and the resource
refered to by <I>D</I> is the value of the property named by the XML element
according to productions [19], [2], and [3]. Specifically; each property
start tag containing attribute specifications other than ID, HREF, or BAGID
results in the creation of a node <I>R</I> where <I>R</I> is the Value
of the property. If HREF is specified, <I>R</I> is the node corresponding
to the resource whose URI is the value of the attribute, else if ID is
specified <I>R</I> is a new node whose identifier is the value of the attribute,
otherwise <I>R</I> is anonymous. Each XML attribute <I>A</I> except ID,
HREF, and BAGID specified with that same property start tag results in
the creation of a property (a triple), where:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The PropObj is the node <I>R</I>.</LI>

<LI>The PropName is the node that represents the resource whose URI is
the expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute name of <I>A</I>.</LI>

<LI>The Value is the attribute value of <I>A</I> (a string).</LI>
</OL>

<P>The value of the BAGID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for
the Bag corresponding to the Description <I>D</I>; else the Bag is anonymous.</P>

<H2><A NAME="signing"></A>5. Signed RDF</H2>

<P>[[<I>This section to be completed</I>]]</P>

<P>Descriptions may be <I>signed</I> to facilitate decisions that require
trust. Simple signatures include checksums or other Descriptions about
independently verifiable characteristics of a resource. The simplest example
of a signature is a statement that the associated Description applies only
to the version of the resource labeled with a given creation date. Stronger
signatures will include cryptographic measures to increase the likelihood
of detection of falsification of or inadvertent changes to the signed Description
or the resource(s) to which it applies.</P>

<H3>6.1. Examples Using the RDF Core</H3>

<P>With the core defined, we can construct and exchange directed graph
models of arbitrary complexity. We could begin by saying very simple things,
such as &quot;John Smith is the Author of the document whose URL is http://www.bar.com/some.doc&quot;.
This description can be modeled with the directed graph:</P>

<CENTER><P>Figure 1: directed graph diagram</P></CENTER>

<P>(We use a notation where nodes are represented as ellipses, arcs as
arrows, and atomic values – i.e. strings – are given in rectangles.) </P>

<P>This small graph can be exchanged in the serialization syntax as: </P>

<P>In most of the example figures the Bag corresponding to the reified

<H3>6.3. Using Binary Relations to Represent Relations of Higher Arity</H3>

<P>The RDF data model intrinsically only supports binary relations. However,
in this section we show how we can represent higher arity relations using
just binary relations. As an example, consider the subject of one of John
Smith's recent articles - library science. We could use the Dewey Decimal
Code for library science to categorize that article. Dewey Decimal codes
are far from the only subject categorization scheme. So we might want to
define a &quot;Subject&quot; node that not only told us the subject of
a paper but also indicated the categorization scheme it came from. That
might look like: </P>

of measure. A person's weight is not just a number like 94, it also requires
us to specify the unit of measure used. In this case we might be using
either pounds or kilograms. We could use a relationship with an additional
arc to record the fact that John Smith is a rather strapping gentleman:</P>

<p>This document is the collective work of all of the above.  The
editors are indebted to each of them for helping to create this document.</p>

<H2><A NAME="namespaces"></A>Appendix A: Brief Explanation of XML Namespaces</H2>

<P>This material is non-normative, but believed necessary for an understanding
of the RDF serialization syntax. It will be replaced by references to the
appropriate sections of [<A HREF="/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>] once they have been published. The material
here is our best understanding of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119">namespace
proposal</A>, but may differ from what the final outcome will be.</P>

<P>The XML Working Group is currently developing a facility that will allow
(at least) Generic Identifiers (tag names) to have a prefix which will
make them unique and will prevent name clashes when developing documents
that mix elements from different schemas. This facility allows a document's
prolog to contain a set of Processing Instructions (PIs) of the form: </P>

<UL>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name=&quot;some-uri&quot; as=&quot;some-abbreviation&quot;?&gt;</PRE>
</UL>

<P>for example </P>

<UL>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#&quot; as=&quot;RDF&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml:namespace name=&quot;http://www.purl.org/metadata/dublin_core#&quot; as=&quot;DC&quot;?&gt;</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Elements in the document may then use generic identifiers of the form
&lt;RDF:Description&gt; or &lt;DC:Title&gt;. Those element names would
expand to URIs such as http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#Description.</P>

<H2><A NAME="usage"></A>Appendix B: Notes about Usage</H2>

<H3>B.1. Property Names</H3>

<P>The RDF serialization and abbreviated syntaxes use XML as their encoding.
XML elements and attributes are case sensitive, so RDF property names are
therefore also case sensitive. This specification does not require any
specific format for property names other than that they be legal XML <I><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-name">names</A></I>.
For its own identifiers, RDF has adopted the convention that all property
names use &quot;InterCap style&quot;; that is, the first letter of the
property name is capitalized and the remainder is lowercase; e.g. <I>Value</I>.
When the property name is a composition of words or fragments of words,
the words are concatenated with the first letter of each word capitalized
and no additional punctutation; e.g. <I>PropName</I>.</P>

<H3>B.2. Namespace URIs</H3>

<P>RDF&nbsp;uses the proposed XML namespace mechanism to implement globally
unique identifiers for all properties. In addition, the namespace URI serves
as the URI of the corresponding RDF&nbsp;schema. An RDF&nbsp;processor
can expect to use the schema URI to access the schema content. This specification
places no further requirements on the content that might be supplied at
that URI, nor how (if at all) the URI might be modified to obtain alternate
forms or a fragment of the schema.</P>

<H3><A NAME="embedHTML"></A>B.3. Embedding in HTML</H3>

<P>The recommended technique for embedding RDF&nbsp;expressions in an HTML&nbsp;document
is simply to insert the RDF in-line. This will make the resulting document
non-conformant to HTML&nbsp;specifications up to and including HTML&nbsp;4.0
but the RDF&nbsp;Working Group hopes that the HTML&nbsp;specification will
evolve to support this. Two practical issues will arise when this technique
is employed with respect to browsers conforming to specifications of HTML
up to and including HTML&nbsp;4.0. Alternatives are available to authors
in these cases; it is up to the author to choose the appropriate alternative
in each circumstance.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Some HTML 2.0 browsers will assume a &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag immediately
before the first RDF&nbsp;element that appears within &lt;HEAD&gt;.<BR>
<BR>
Authors concerned about very old browsers may place all RDF expressions
at the end of the document head.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>All HTML&nbsp;browsers conforming to specifications up to and including
HTML&nbsp;4.0 will render any content appearing in RDF property values
expressed as XML&nbsp;element types (i.e. production [17]).<BR>
<BR>
Authors concerned about preventing their RDF&nbsp;content from rendering
in old browsers may use the abbreviated syntax to move the property value
into an attribute. Not all properties can be expressed this way.</LI>
</OL>

<P>In the event that none of the alternatives above provides the capabilities
desired by the author, the RDF&nbsp;expressions may be left external to
the HTML document and linked with an HTML &lt;LINK&gt; element. The recommended
relation type for this purpose is REL=&quot;meta&quot;; e.g.</P>

<UL>
<PRE>&lt;link rel=&quot;meta&quot; href=&quot;mydocMetadata&quot;&gt;</PRE>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="viaHTTP"></A>B.4 Transporting in HTTP Headers</H3>

<P>We specify a simple extension to HTTP that allows a client to request
that RDF metadata be included in a header along with the document. We deal
here only with the HTTP protocol; we hope that other protocols will be
similarly extended.</P>

<P>[[<I>This section to be completed.</I>]]</P>

<H3><A NAME="serviceBureau"></A>B.5 Requesting Metadata via HTTP</H3>

<P>RDF&nbsp;metadata can also be retrieved separately from the resource(s)
to which it refers. To request metadata in this way, a client contacts
a metadata service bureau. A service bureau is an HTTP server that understands
a particular query syntax. It can provide metadata for documents that reside
on other servers as well as for documents available through protocols other
than HTTP.</P>

<P>[[<I>This section to be completed.</I>]]</P>

<H2><A NAME="openIssues"></A>Appendix C: Open Issues</H2>

<H3>C.1. Resource Scope</H3>

<P>Should RDF introduce a way for an HREF to refer to a collection of resources
which cannot be enumerated in any simple way (for example, by providing
a URI &quot;prefix&quot; and indicating that the target is the collection
of URIs with that prefix). The mechanism could also provide ways of restricting
the set of URIs selected (e.g., only certain media types would qualify).</P>

<H3>C.2. Mandatory Extensions</H3>

<P>In PICS, there is a need for specifying that if a processing agent does
not understand the semantics of a certain property the entire &quot;label&quot;
should be discarded. The question for the RDF specification is whether
it is sufficient to say that this is a problem which needs to be addressed
by those designing a PICS schema for RDF, or whether a mechanism like this
should be part of the core RDF.</P>

<H3>C.6. Canonicalization of Models</H3>

<P>Section 2 makes reference to testing the equivalence of RDF&nbsp;expressions.
We need a definition of a canonical form for an instance of an RDF&nbsp;data
model to permit comparison of two such instances. This canonical form will
likely be produced by eliminating triples that represent reified properties
but that are not used elsewhere in the model.</P>

<h3>C.7. Support for schemes (ala Dublin Core)</h3>
<p>This issue is deferred pending input from Dublin Core community
and further experience with the use of namespaces</p>

<p><i>Scheme</i> is a term used in the Dublin Core community to denote the
specific controlled vocabulary from which a Value has been chosen.  Examples
of vocabularies covered by schemes include units of measure, library
subject heading codes, and Dewey Decimal numbers.  This same facility
might also be used to denote a particular encoding format; e.g. date in
ISO 8601 form, or name in "family, given" form.  We recognize that
this mechanism will be common to many RDF applications and it seems
appropriate to indicate a recommended practice in the core specification.</p>


<H3>C.10. Interactions between XML Markup Declarations and RDF</H3>

<P>We have noticed in the description discussion that there are features
of XML -- such as XLL (XML-link) -- that may have unanticipated side- effects
on the intended RDF semantics. In particular, markup declarations in the
document prolog may cause the XML parser to alter the interpretation of
an RDF element. We need to evaluate the impact of such processing, especially
in the context of digitally signed RDF descriptions.</P>

<h3>C.20. Namespace defaulting</h3>
<p>This issue is deferred pending a decision on XML namespaces by
the XML Working Group</p>

<p>Should RDF specify the method for determining a namespace when a
namespace qualifier is omitted?</p>

<H3>C.21. Distributive referents</H3>

<P>A concise mechanism is desired to state properties that apply to each
element of a collection rather than to the collection as a whole.</P>

<h3>C.22. How to compute the property type URI</h3>
<p>This issue is deferred pending a decision on XML namespaces by the
XML Working Group</p>

<p>The XML namespace proposal does not specify how the namespace URI is
to be combined with a qualified element name to produce a URI for the
element description.  RDF would like to be able to compute a URI to
access the RDF Schema definition of a particular property type.<p>

<h3>C.23. Language tagging of substrings</h3>
<p>This issue will be deferred until after the 1.0 specification.</p>

<p>A property value may need to be a string tagged in multiple languages;
how do we accomplish this?</p>

<h3>C.24. Requesting Metadata via HTTP</h3>

<p>We need to specify how a client can request RDF metadata separately
from the resource to which the metadata refers. This protocol is
necessary to enable metadata service bureaus.</p>

<h3>C.25. Transporting in HTTP Headers</h3>

<p>We need to specify how RDF metadata will be transported in an HTTP
header so that a client can request metadata along with the resource
when it is infeasible or inappropriate to embed the metadata inside
the resource.</p>
